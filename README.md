# Neighborhoodize

Neighborhoodize uses `fastkml` and `shapely` to determine what Chicago neighborhood a latitude, longitude pair resides in.

## Other implementations

jkgiesler's [`chicago_neighborhoods`](https://github.com/jkgiesler/chicago_neighborhoods) provides similar functionality without dependencies.

## Future of this project
(see Issues for details/to make suggestions)

 - ability to use Chicago community areas or wards instead of 2012 neighborhoods
 - ability to use subarb boundaries for Chicagoland areas not inside the city limits
 - additional cities
